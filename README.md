# üß™ Lab 1: Domain Controller Setup and Promotion

**Goal:** Set up a Windows Server 2022 Standard Evaluation VM, configure a static IP, and promote it to a Domain Controller using Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS).

---

## üß† Why this lab matters (SOC Analyst mindset)

As a Tier 1 SOC Analyst, I'll investigate suspicious logins, privilege escalation, and authentication issues. Many of these trace back to Active Directory. This lab helps me understand how a Domain Controller is built, how it works, and why it's a high value target in many attacks.

## üíª Tools Used

- Windows Server 2022 Standard Evaluation VM (named `DC-01`)
- Server Manager
- Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)
- DNS Server
- Static IP Configuration

## üîß Key Steps

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Launch and Configure Server Manager

- Confirmed Server Manager opened and local server was recognized.

---

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Configure Static IP Address

[![Lab1 Step2 Static Ip Configured](./lab1_step2_static_ip_configured.png)](./lab1_step2_static_ip_configured.png)


- IP Address: `192.168.100.10`  
- Subnet Mask: `255.255.255.0`  
- DNS Server: `127.0.0.1`

üîç **Why this matters:** Creating a private lab environment. This keeps the VM off the public internet. Using `127.0.0.1` as DNS means the server will refer to itself for name resolution.

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Promote the Server to a Domain Controller

[![Lab1 Step3 Promote Domain Controller](./lab1_step3_promote_domain_controller.png)](./lab1_step3_promote_domain_controller.png)


- Created a new forest named `cyberlab.local`

üßµ Think of a forest like a neighborhood, and the domain `cyberlab.local` is a gated community where all the trusted devices live.

---

### ‚úÖ Step 4: Domain Controller Options

[![Lab1 Step4 Domain Controller Options](./lab1_step4_domain_controller_options.png)](./lab1_step4_domain_controller_options.png)

- Selected Domain Functional Level: Windows Server 2016  
- Checked DNS and Global Catalog  
- Set DSRM (Directory Services Restore Mode) password

---

### ‚úÖ Step 5: DNS Delegation Warning

[![Lab1 Step5 Dns Options](./lab1_step5_dns_options.png)](./lab1_step5_dns_options.png)


- Received a yellow warning: "A delegation for this DNS server cannot be created..."
- Did **not** check the "Create DNS delegation" box  
- ‚úÖ This is expected for isolated lab environments

---

### ‚úÖ Step 6: NetBIOS and Review

[![Lab1 Step6 Netbios Name](./lab1_step6_netbios_name.png)](./lab1_step6_netbios_name.png)

- NetBIOS name auto-generated: `CYBERLAB`

---

### ‚úÖ Step 7: Final Review Before Installation

[![Lab1 Step7 Paths](./lab1_step7_paths.png)](./lab1_step7_paths.png)

- Confirmed database, log, and SYSVOL folder locations

---

### ‚úÖ Step 8: Prerequisite Check and Reboot

[![Lab1 Step9 Prerequisite Check](./lab1_step9_prerequisite_check.png)](./lab1_step9_prerequisite_check.png)

- All checks passed, install completed  
- The server rebooted automatically

---

### ‚úÖ Step 9: Confirm AD DS and DNS Roles Installed

[![Lab1 Step10 Domain Controller Ready](./lab1_step10_domain_controller_ready.png)](./lab1_step10_domain_controller_ready.png)

- Server Manager shows both AD DS and DNS with green status  
- Domain Controller is up and running

---

### ‚úÖ Step 10: Investigate Red Warning (Non-Critical)

[![Lab1 Step7 Check Server Health Noncritical](./lab1_step7_check_server_health_noncritical_service_stopped.png)](./lab1_step7_check_server_health_noncritical_service_stopped.png)

- Red alert was caused by the Clipboard User Service being stopped  
- ‚úÖ This has no impact on AD DS or DNS and is safe to ignore

---

## üîÆ Reflection Question

**Q: What types of logs or alerts might indicate suspicious behavior on a domain controller?**

**A:** I would look for failed login attempts, account lockouts, or tools accessing `ntds.dit`. If I saw logon events outside of business hours or sudden group membership changes, that could be suspicious. I'd also check for PowerShell or scheduled tasks interacting with sensitive AD files.
